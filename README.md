# AmeliorMate
## AmeliorMate Python Library
This is a python library made to help with GPT3 chatbots.

It has one object, ChatBot(), which has three methods:
- set_key, which takes your OpenAI API key and sets it so you can use the API
- proto_chat, which takes nothing and opens your chatbot in the terminal so you can test it
- prod_chat, which takes a string and outputs a string response generated by GPT3
